1) Create a Folder
	--> mkdir Testing
        --> cd Testing

2) Generate some empty files:-
	--> type nul > test.py (touch test.py)
	--> type nul > demo.js (touch demo.js)

3) Initialize a Local Git Repository
	--> git init

4) Adding the files from directory to staging area
	--> git add .

5) Status of your working directory and staging area
	--> git status

6) Permanently record the staged changes into Git Repo History
	--> git commit -m "first commit"

7) Create a remote repo with the name origin
	--> git remote add origin <link to github repo>

8) Push the commits from local main branch to the remote origin branch
	--> git push -u origin main
	--> Note that After setting upstream (-u) no need to use origin main again

9) You may have to login to your github for this step (if not already logged in)

10) Add Readme file in github repo and pull it to see changes in local directory
	--> git pull origin main
	--> Note that as we have already setup upstream even git pull shall work

11) Create a branch and check after checking out
	--> git checkout -b branch_name
	--> git branch

12) Open test.py file and add print statement there, stage the changes, commit and push
	--> test.py
	--> print('hello world!')
	--> git add .
	--> git commit -m "added code in test.py"
	--> git push -u origin backend
	--> Note, this time backend branch has no upstream branch

13) Check the github branches, create pull request and merge it.
	--> As you are the only one who has created other branch you will see merge too
	--> Check the process
